# Vue.js technical test

Technical test taken by Will Halling on June 2020. 

Project stack includes:
 
* Vue.js
* Video.js
* VueSlickCarousel

I've added reusable components: PlayButton & Heading.

I've added Vuex to manage the state.

I've added SCSS and used BEM methodology.

For info: I've saved the movies.json api locally so I can send a preview link.
